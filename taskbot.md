## Problem Description and objectives
- Generally clear description, it's easy to get a broad understanding of what you are trying to achieve
- A brief description of what you mean by multi-modal interaction is would have been helpful, while you obviously don't want to explain every single peice of terminology that you use this seems to be fundamental to what you're trying to do here - yet I still don't have an understanding of what this is after reading your proposal. 

## Background and rationale
- Very well researched, you clearly have a good knowledge of the literature
- You do a good job of identifying the current shortcomings of conversational interfaces and this helps to motivate why the proposed work is important 

## Key Idea
- There is a strong core idea here 

## Methodology
- You clearly have a good knowledge of the technical aspects involved in realising the system that you describe. I don't have the domain expertise to comment on their validity, but you seem confident on the concrete steps that will be required.
- The description of how the system will be implemented is thourough, but there isn't any discussion on how you plan on evaluating the effectiveness of the system. Do you plan on evaluating the effectiveness of a handful of systems that were implemented using the framework? Perhaps since you are aiming to create a flexible research platform you might want to give the system to some researches and gather qualitative data about their use?

## Overall organisation and theme
- The organisation is good.
- Personally I would have put the "Key Research Contributions" section after the abstract - this is a bit more upfront and gives the reader more information on what they are to expect in the rest of the proposal

## General presentation and language
- Abbreviations used without first introducing them unabbreviated. Ie QA could also be quality assurance. It's fairly obvious if you specialise in NLP - but having to double take things like this can break flow for the reader if they aren't as familiar with the specific area
- More generally things are often introduced with the assumption that the reader will know what they are, again this doesn't overly egregious but can break the flow for the reader. For example, writing "... will be built using open-source web-crawling API Common Crawl" instead of simply "Common Crawl" would have saved me opening a new browser tab to search common crawl before continuing reading.
